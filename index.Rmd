## Approaches to Asset Pricing

1. Empirical models with traded factors
   - Fama and French; Recent ML-based approaches
2. Empirical models with non-traded factors
   - Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) and work using macroeconomic series as pricing factors
3. Euler equation models based on a class of investors
   - Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) as well as recent literature on broker-dealers
4. Macro-finance models that specify preferences, beliefs, technology constraints
5. Asset demand system approach
   - Koijen and Yogo (2019) and others
